# Hi, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹
  I have a degree in Computer Engineering from the Technological University of Chile INACAP, I have taken courses on productivity and effective time management among others  in the online education platform Platzi.
  
  For the final project that I presented, and with which I defended my thesis, I was responsible for coding from start to finish a mobile application in flutter interacting with firebase to display data in real time. I managed to learn on my own what I needed to develop both the mobile application and an interface for the end user using the Arduino esp32 microcontroller. 
  
  ## I am currently focused on web development, i'm making an application focused on helping chronic patients to keep track of their medical conditions.

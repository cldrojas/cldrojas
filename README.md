# Svelte starter

Svelte starter is the easiest way to initialize an [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) project, including webpack, miniCss and babel.

To create a new project based on this template

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/cld_rojas/svelte-starter svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

Note that you will need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

## Get Started


Install the dependencies....

```bash
cd svelte-starter
npm install
```

...then start webpack:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Navigate to localhost:8080. You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the page should reload with your changes.
